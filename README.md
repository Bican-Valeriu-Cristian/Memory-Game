Memory Game is an entertaining and instructive game that helps users improve and assess their memory. Java was used to create the project's game logic, HTML and CSS were used for the design and visual layout, and the Vue plugin was used to create responsive and dynamic user interactions. I added photos of vehicle brands to the game to make it more visually appealing and interactive.
